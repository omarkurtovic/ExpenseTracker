📈 Better error handling - Global error boundaries, graceful failures
📈 Loading states - Spinners, skeleton screens
📈 CSV export - Data export is huge for portfolios
📈 More complex filtering - Date ranges, multi-select, search
📈 Responsive polish - Make mobile experience great, not just "works"
📈 Seeded demo data - So reviewers can see it populated immediately
📈 README with screenshots - Show it off properly
Current weaknesses:
⚠️ Login loop bug - This will hurt in demos
⚠️ Limited mobile responsiveness - "A bit" isn't enough for 2025
⚠️ No demo/live version? - Hard to show off without deployment
